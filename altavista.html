    <p>  You might have heard of <a href= "altavista.com">altavista.com</a>, right? If you don't know, it was a <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine">search engine</a> from the 90's and has helped develop the Web as we know it today.
     Alta Vista was aquired in 2003 by "Yahoo!" and shut down it's free email service with 400,000 registered accounts that include 200,000 active. Now, Alta Vista is owned by <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Media">Verizon Media.</a> After it's closing in 2013,
    <a href= "altavista.com">altavista.com</a> is still a website. But, if you try to type in altavista.com, Google Chrome will block it, but if you get past it, it just redirects you to the <a href= "https://yahoo.com">"Yahoo!"</a> home page. This means Alta Vista is gone for ever. (sad music)</p>
