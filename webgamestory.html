<p style= "color: white">So you're bored, and you dont want to download a application, right? Well you have come to the right place! Here are the best web games based on who you are.</p>
<br>
<h2 style= "color: white">Derby Crash</h2>
<p style= "color: white">A online BeamNG? Not exactly, although you can say that the sofbody is like crumpling paper, it is pretty decent for a online game. There are also portals that engage
every few minutes to teleport you to the height of the bordering mountians so you can take in the scenery while tumbling down to the "brick hard" sand.
<h3 style= "color: white"><a href= "https://crazygames.com/game/derby-crash/>Play Here!</a></h3>
<br>
<h2 style= "color: white">Surviv.io</h2>
<p style: "color: white">Now, for the people who like FFA battle royale games like the Minecraft Hunger games and Fortnite now have an online alternative that I could say one thing about,
It is epic, it has an account option and a no-account option, MMO teams with up to four player capacities, easy gameplay, and last but not least, action-packed... well action.</p>
<h3 style: "color: white"><a href= "https://surviv.io">Play Here!</a></h3>
<br>
<h2 style: "color: white">Derby Crash 2</h2>
<p style= "color: white">A sequel to Derby Crash, It is considerably way better than the orignal, all new vehicles were added, the only car that was from DC1 was the "brutal" Ramp Car.
It also adds a tank that can fire explosive bullets that can annhilate cars and can even flip them if hit at the right position! It is so fun that you can even forget that it is only a
online game.</p>

<br>
<h2 style: "color: white">Air Wars 2</h2>
<p style= "color: white">A engaging MMO air combat game, with accounts and 2 maps that glow in the dark, dont forget about its large community and wide variety of features, unlike others,
you can create your own rooms and even join others by room name or player name! There are player levels which unlock you planes that are more powerful, and even aircraft updates! This is 
one of the BEST games I have ever played! Thank you to the devs at Martian Games for making this extremely fun game. Play with Me @Good Job You</p>

<h2 style: "color: white">Motor Wars 2</h2>
<p style= "color: white">All the fun of AW2, But with land vehicles!(I'll explain that) Cars and Tanks and Lambos all running on the same AW2 system/engine! Play with me @Blade2018yt</p>

<br>
<h2 style: "color: white">Unbounded</h2>
<p style= "color: white">A online drifter game like Midnight Club, this has real cars and you can customize the car's visuals and internal parts! This is a state-of the art
game provided my M3 Productions. Play with Me @OOF12345.</p>
